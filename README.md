 
<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Tonny</h1>

I am currently a final-year student at Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. Major in Biotechnology in Medicine.

My fields of interest are Machine Learning and Data Visualization. Currently, I'm focusing on the application of Machine Learning.

I am thoroughly competent in R and Python. Besides those two, I have also accumulated an understanding of some new technologies by watching YouTube videos, and reading articles, as well as acquainted myself with basic Informative Design and Web Building. I am always open to opportunities to further expand my horizon and experience. At this time, I am looking for an internship in hopes of developing my expertise.
