 
<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Tonny</h1>

I am currently a final year student at Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. Major in Biotechnology in Medicine.

My fields of interest are Machine Learning and Data Visualization. Currently, I'm focusing on the application of Machine Learning on biological data.

I am thoroughly competent in R and Python. Besides those two, I have also accumulated an understanding of some new technologies by watching YouTube videos, and reading articles, as well as acquainted myself with basic Informative Design and Web Building. I am always open to opportunities to further expand my horizon and experience. At this time, I am looking for an internship in hopes of developing my expertise.
